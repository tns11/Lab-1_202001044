Title: Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements





Answer to Q1:


The Functional Requirements (FRs) identified by me are:

    1. User (member) login (includes authentication)
    2. Continue as guest (option to continue without logging in, if the user is not currently a member)
    3. For members:
                  browse available books
                  borrow (a book)
                       return (a book)
                       renew (the renew button should be enabled when an already borrowed book is selected and no other booking for that particular book has been made)









The Non Functional Requirements (NFRs) identified by me are:

    1. Easy to use and navigate
    2. User Experience of navigating must seem logical.
    3. Must be accessible only from within the intranet.
    4. Must be scalable as the number of research scholars, students, professors, and employees of the institute, ad hence the Library Information System members may increase.
    5.
