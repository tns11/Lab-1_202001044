Title: Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements





Answer to Q1:


The Functional Requirements (FRs) identified by me are:

    1. User (member) login (includes authentication)
    2. Continue as guest (option to continue without logging in, if the user is not currently a member)
    3. For members:
                  a) browse available books
                  b) borrow (a book)
                  c) return (a book)
                  d) renew (the renew button should be enabled when an already borrowed book is selected and no other booking for that particular book has been made)

    4. For the librarian (administrator):
                  a) add a new book to the catalog
                  b) remove a book from the catalog
                  
    5. Replacing the confidential information (ex. Password) with filled circle while displaying.
    6. Encryption of confidential information before storing it (to the remote server).







The Non Functional Requirements (NFRs) identified by me are:

    1. Easy to use and navigate
    2. User Experience of navigating must seem logical.
    3. Must be accessible only from within the intranet.
    4. Must be scalable as the number of research scholars, students, professors, and employees of the institute, and hence the Library Information System members may         increase.
    5. Must be flexible to incorporate changes in the research facilities/ any other change.
    6. Must be responsive to user inputs
    7. The features of borrowing/returning/renewing a book must be available during the working hours of the library.
    8. security
    
    
    
   Answer to Q2:
   
   The scope of the product is to alert about and log key sound events to the community suffering from hearing loss.
   
   
   Functional Aspects identified by me:
   
      1. Recognise key sound events of interest to user.
      2. Produce an alert where required.
      3. Generate logs
      4. Display logging information
   
   Non- functional aspects identified by me:
   
     1.  Real-time
     2.  Available whenever user requires it.
     3.  The alerts are immediately recognisable by the user. (The design of alert popping must be such that the user can immediately notice it, as it can be a question of life, when the specially-abled is on road, and a car is speeding to the person, horning him in the hope the person would give side)
     4.  The AI must be robust, be error free to provide error-free results, instantly. 
     5.  The app must be easy to use.
